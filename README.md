##Drupal 8 admin theme symbol library.

This is a collection of symbols for quickly mocking up Drupal web applications, created by Nenad Scuric and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.


###Getting Started
To use files you will need [Sketch] (http://www.sketchapp.com/). Why do we use Sketch instead of Photoshop? It is very simple tool made for user interface design, it is 100% vector, created elements have reusable styles and in the end it is code-friendly. 

More about sketch [blog.mengto.com/sketch-vs-photoshop] (http://blog.mengto.com/sketch-vs-photoshop/).

###Is Sketch available for Windows or Linux? 

Due to the technologies and frameworks exclusive to OS X that Sketch has been built upon, regrettably we will not be considering supporting Sketch on either of these platforms.
